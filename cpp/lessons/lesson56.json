  "description": "So far, we’ve been creating objects and then setting their fields by hand. C++ lets you run special code **automatically** when an object is created. That special function is called a **constructor**.\n\nA constructor:\n\n- has the same name as the class\n- has **no return type** (not even `void`)\n- runs automatically when you create an object\n\nExample:\n\n```cpp\nclass User {\npublic:\n    std::string name;\n    int userid;\n\n    // constructor\n    User(std::string n, int id) {\n        name = n;\n        userid = id;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nNow you can create a `User` like this:\n\n```cpp\nUser u(\"Alice\", 42); // calls the constructor\n```\n\nThe constructor sets up the fields so the object starts in a valid state.\n\n---\n\n## Your task\n\nCBit OS still uses the `Counter` class, but they want to make it easier to create.\n\nUpdate the `Counter` class so that:\n\n- It still has a **public** `int` field named `value`.\n- It has a constructor that takes one `int` parameter and sets `value` to that number.\n\nThe tests in `main` will create two `Counter` objects with different starting values. Make sure your constructor sets `value` correctly.\n",
  "starterCode": "#include <iostream>\n// don't touch above this\n\nclass Counter {\npublic:\n    int value;\n\n    // add a constructor here\n};\n\n// don't touch below this\nint main() {\n    Counter a(5);\n    Counter b(10);\n\n    if (a.value != 5) {\n        std::cout << \"[FAIL] a.value should be 5\\\\n\";\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (b.value != 10) {\n        std::cout << \"[FAIL] b.value should be 10\\\\n\";\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"[PASS]\\\\n\";\n}\n",
