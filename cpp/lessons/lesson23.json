Returning returns a value, not write to console. you store those values by puting a variable on the outside of the function call.\n\nYour assignment is to implement a function called 'Multiply' that takes two integer arguments and returns the value of them multiplyed together. then, write code the declares a variable x, and calls your funciton with the arguments 3, and 4 and stores the output in x",
