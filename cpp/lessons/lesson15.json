  "description": "In C++ _(and all coding languages)_ You are able to do ### Math\n_I know, scary, right?_ Well, it's pretty simple. You even get to use the operators you already know. Right now i will cover 8_(more like 4)_ arithmitic operators.\n\nFirst, there is +(addition(How could you not know that)) put plus between _**2**_ variables _or numbers **or both**_ and it will add them together. The same basic rules folow. -=subtraction, *=multiply, /=divide. However, if you use these, you might realize that nothing happens when you use them. thats because there is no equals sign. You are doing the comparison, and throwing the value into the abyss. You have to do variableyouwantanswerin = variablyouwantanswerin + othernumber, but there is shorthand, +=. x = x + y is equivelent to x+=y. this shorthand exists for all operators. One more important rule is that you are supposed to put a space between operatos. 2+2*3/1=bad 2 + 2 * 3 / 1 = good.\n\nYour job is to add the variable y into x, multiply it by 2, and then put that value into variable z",
