You puy & before a variable, and it returns the position of it in memory, which is the memory **_Adress_**. \n\nThe CBit OS team wants to check that their operating system doesn't manage to fail at storing memory adresses.\n\nYou must fix the code so it outputs the adress of x insteado f x. _We will cover more on memory in the future._",
