  "description": "An overloaded function is when a function has multiple definitions/declerations. They have the same name, but different arguments. For example, a function called \"Add\". You could make one functio nthats signiture is int Add(int a, int b), and one that is int Add(int a, int b, int c), and then it would call the firts one if you used Add(1, 3) and the second if you used Add(9, 1, 4). \n\nThe CBit OS team needs you to write a function that creates a directory from files! The problem is, the team doesnt know the number of files, there could be 2, 3, or 4. You must write an overloaded function, makeDir that returnes a string thats contents are: \"Dirname contents are: item1, item2, item3, item4\". The arguments passed will be the name of the directory(Dirname), item1, item2. For the second one, it will also have item3, and item4 forthe 3rd one. The order of arguments will be dirname, item1, item2.... the return should be a strings, same for the arguments.",
