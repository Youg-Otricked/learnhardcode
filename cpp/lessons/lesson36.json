  "description": "Congrats! You have learned loops!. As a refresher, loops are used to repete a section of code multiple times. Use this playground bellow to practice! Once you are ready, Make the main func and a loop that prints \"I know loops in C++!\\n\" 5 times, to sink in the knowledge. From know on, all of the harder lessons will have a solution file, but remember, loding one resetts your lessons-in-a-row streak!",
