 "description": "Now it is time to cover `public:` and `private:`.\n\nPublic and private fields and methods are very important. `public` means **anything** that has access to the object can access that field or method. `private` means **only** methods of *this* class (and friends) can access it.\n\nYou declare them like this:\n\n```cpp\nclass Example {\n    public:\n        int x;      // public field\n\n    private:\n        int thisthing;     // private field\n};\n```\n\nFool around and practice in the playground (the more OOP practice, the better), then answer:\n\n## How would you make a private field `ip` in a class?\n",
