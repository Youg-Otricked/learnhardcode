  "description": "To define a function, you type typeofreeturn name(args) {codegoeshere}; Args will be explaind in a later lesson. Main is a function that returns int(a error code). If a funciton returns nothing, you use return type void. to define a function that returns char named gettab the sig would be char gettab() {}. You put functions either before of arfter main. before means you just write it normallly, after mean you have to put a header sayin the function name at the top of the file, EG: char getlegs();. returning is simple. You dont keep values from functions, they are bassically thrown away oncethe function runs. To keep a value, you do return value;. note that the type of the value must be the retunr type of the function. To call the function, you just write functionname(args); to call a funciton that takes no args and returns nothing that is called get, you write get();. if it returns a value, you can put a variable, eg with our get function, char z = get();\n\nAnswer the following question: \nWhat is a valid function **_Header_** for a function that returns a double",
