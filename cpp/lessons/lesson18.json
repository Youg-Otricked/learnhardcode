  "description": "So far, the flow has been simple: write code, run it, and match the exact output. That works for tiny programs, but it doesn’t scale when we start writing **functions.**\nFrom this point on, you’ll start seeing somthing new:\n## Unit Tests:\n\nYou write _only the function_ the lesson asks for **(no main())**.\nWhen you click Run, a hidden test harness calls your function with a few sample inputs.\nmWhen you click Submit, the harness runs many more tests, including tricky edge cases.\nThink of it like shipping your code to real users: Run is your quick local check, Submit is the full test suite.\nThe function lessons will ramp up in difficulty, but the tests will always tell you _exactly_ how your function is behaving.",
