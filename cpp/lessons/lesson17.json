  "description": "There are 4 more common operators you need to learn: %, %=, ++, and --. ++ increments numbers by 1, -- decrements them. If x is 5 x++; maeks x 6. however there is an important rule. lets say y is 6 ad x is 3. if you do y = x++; twill now equal 3 and x will be 3. however if you do y = ++x;, x and y = 4. % gives teh remainder, so 3 % 2 = 1. Like +=, %= is just short hand for var = var % var2\n\nHow would you get the remainder of 5 ++ / 4",
