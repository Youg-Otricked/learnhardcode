  "hint": "You can make an item of a struct by doing either structname varname; and then varname.structfeilname = value; for each field, or structname varname = {varfields in order}. You can return any type fro ma struct by making the return type that name.\nAn advanced thing(try making the varibale then returning it first) is C++ is smart, so if you define the return type, you can just write return {structfieldsdef}; and it will work. As you probably have noticed, you cannot return multiple values from a function in c++, however, you can return an enum and use that as multiple values."
