  "description": "A Contsant is a variable that cannot be changed for any reason. You define/initilize a constant with const normalvardecleration; so somthing like const int MAX = 100;. No, i did not just have a seizure or hit caps lock, in C++, there are a few naming conventions. You typically name variables in snake case, and make it so you dont need comments to understand you variables. Make them have descriptive name, eg: bad names: const int users = 1001;, int thisThing = 2;. good names: const int MAX_USERS = 1001;, int number_of_transactions = 2;. see the diference that that simple change made?.\n\nAnswer the following question: Which variable is a constant that follows correct naming conventions.",
