For the rest of this course, you will be coding for a fictional company, __BitFoundry systems__, working on a project called **_CBit OS_**.\nIn CPP, you can make a while loop like this: While(condition) {do this}. when the condition is false ,the loop stops.\n\nCBit OS's main loop of passing files has failed!. Write a while loop that runs tilll the variable i > 10 and adds one to i at the begining of each cycle, and then prints i without a newline.",
