  "description": "In C++, There is another type of control flow, it is called a switch statment. A switch is equivelent to a long chain of if els if..... else. How you write switch is: switch(variable) { case valuea:\n        code\n        break;\n    case valueb:\n        code\n        break;\n    ...\n case default:\n        code\n        break;\n}. Each case is equivelent to a if/else fi statment, and the default is eqquivelent to an else. In the lesson, your challenge is to write a switch statment on var s that prints a for 1, b for 2, and c for 3, and d for all other values. Do not put a \\n after each value",
