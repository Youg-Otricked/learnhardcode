  "description": "In C++, to print to console, two things are necesary. A: importing iostream. at the very top of the file, #include <iostream>. this imports the standerd librarys console input/output library. The way you actually print is by typing std:::cout followed by the output operator << then either a variable(which will be coverd later) or a number/ string, so for a string you put quotes and then want you want to type, like \"text\" then a semicolon. all statments in c++ end in ;. after you have your text, you can also output an escape squense. this is a special series of charecters that does things. \\n is a good example. \\n represents a newline charecter, so after your text before the semicolon, you put << '\\n'; to type a newline. You may be thinking \"Why are there single quotes instead of double quotes?\". The reason is not a style choice, instead it is that escape squences are not a string, their type is actually a charecter(char). The char data type represents a single ascii charecter, escape sequence, or 4-digit unicode charecter, and all chars are wrapped in single quotes only, nothing else works. \n\nYour challenge is to print to console the exact string \"I like C++\" followed by a newline.",
