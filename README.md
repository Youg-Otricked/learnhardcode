# This is a website for learning C++, rust, and C#. This will eventually also be for java.
## Just open the site at [https://learnhardcode.dpdns.org/home.html](https://learnhardcode.dpdns.org/home.html) If you install the files, run uncache.py and open localhost:9000/home.html. If you get errors on correct lessons, open dev tools, and hard refresh(ctrl+shift+r) until hello.js says "hello.js?v=XXX" in the networktab. Alsom go to dev tools, and in storage clear local storage, cookies, and cache storage. that will garuntee fix it.
#### Please leave any bugs or errors in the Issues
_**Note that the C#, Rust, and C++ courses are not finished. C++ has 52 lesosn and counting, C# has 4(5?) lesson and rust has 5. I am activly working on making more lessons. I hope to go as in depth as i can. There will most likely be around 80-120 lessons per course.**_
