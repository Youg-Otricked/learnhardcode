# This is a website for learning C++. This will eventually also be for java rust and C#.
## Just open the github pages at [https://github.io/Youg-Otricked/learnhardcode/home.html](https://youg-otricked.github.io/learnhardcode/home.html) If you install the files, run uncache.py and open localhost:9000/home.html. If you get errors on correct lessons, open dev tools, and hard refresh(ctrl+shift+r) until hello.js says "hello.js?v=XXX" in the networktab. Alsom go to dev tools, and in storage clear local storage, cookies, and cache storage. that will garuntee fix it.
#### Please leave any bugs or errors in the Issues
