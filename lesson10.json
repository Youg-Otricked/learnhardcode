  "description": "All a variable is is a location in memory that you give a name to that stores data. how you define a variable is: datatype name; or datatype name = value; where datatype is a datatype(EG char) name is the name you want the variable to have, and value is the data you want to store. For example int z = 123;. Your challenge is to make a char called z with data \\t (This is the escape sequence for tab), and a variable num with the value 17. Remember, to output a variable with cout you just put the variable name after <<. Sorry for the hard first lesson.",
